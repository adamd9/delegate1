# **Seeing the Structure: A Practical Model for ThoughtFlow in Agentic AI**

We don’t need another chat UI.
What we need is a way to **see how work actually happens** inside an agent — how user inputs, reasoning steps, and tool calls combine to produce results.

This is where **ThoughtFlow** comes in: a structured, machine- and human-readable representation of every session, every run, and every step.

---

## **1. The Core Idea**

Every agent interaction is more than just a transcript. It’s a **structured process**:

* **Sessions**: the outer container for all activity in a conversation or workflow.
* **Runs**: discrete tasks that begin with a **user input** or system trigger.
* **Steps**: the building blocks of a run — model calls, tool invocations, memory operations, and user messages.
* **Artifacts**: the inputs and outputs of steps, like raw prompts, assistant replies, tool responses, or stored values.

Together, these form a **ThoughtFlow**: a traceable structure the platform can use for **debugging, analysis, optimization, and even self-reflection**.

---

## **2. Entities and Relationships**

| Entity       | Purpose                                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Session**  | Container for related runs (one conversation, one job, or one context).    |
| **Run**      | A single task starting with a user input or a trigger.                     |
| **Step**     | One atomic operation (chat input, LLM call, tool call, memory read/write). |
| **Artifact** | Data created or consumed by steps (messages, API results, memory entries). |
| **Edges**    | Links between steps and artifacts that show cause-and-effect.              |

Think of this less like a “chat log” and more like a **structured event log with relationships**.

## **3. Example ThoughtFlow (Production-Style)**

A simple weather interaction produces a ThoughtFlow like this:

**Session**: `sess_2025-09-02`
**Run 1** (User asks for weather)

* `chat.on_message` ("what’s the weather today?")
* `responses.request` → LLM clarifies location
* `assistant.output` ("To fetch today’s weather, I need your location...")

**Run 2** (User provides city)

* `chat.on_message` ("canberra")
* `nlp.normalize_location` → lat/long
* `tool.get_weather_from_coords` → returns `{ temp: 2°C, summary: "chilly" }`
* `assistant.output` ("In Canberra right now it’s about 2°C (very chilly).")

**Run 3** (User requests to remember)

* `chat.on_message` ("thanks, you should remember that im based in canberra")
* `responses.request` → agent asks for confirmation
* `chat.on_message` ("yes")
* `tool.mem_add` (key=user.base\_location, value=Canberra\_AU)
* `assistant.output` ("Got it — I’ll remember you’re based in Canberra...")

## **4. Why ThoughtFlow Matters**

### **For humans**

* **Debugging:** Stop digging through raw logs; see clear runs and steps.
* **Analysis:** Spot bottlenecks, latency spikes, or repeated tool failures.
* **Audit:** Reconstruct exactly what happened during any interaction.

### **For the agent**

* **Reflection:** Identify where reasoning or actions failed.
* **Optimization:** Detect slow steps or high-error paths automatically.
* **Memory management:** Consolidate useful artifacts, discard noise.
* **Adaptation:** Improve planning by learning from past successful flows.

---

## **5. JSON as the Source of Truth**

All ThoughtFlow diagrams and dashboards should be generated from a single, structured JSON representation.

### **Example Schema**

```
{
  "session_id": "sess_2025-09-02",
  "started_at": "2025-09-02T20:11:35.442Z",
  "runs": [
    {
      "run_id": "run_1",
      "trigger": "chat.on_message",
      "input_text": "what’s the weather today?",
      "steps": [
        {
          "step_id": "s1",
          "type": "chat.on_message",
          "payload": "what’s the weather today?",
          "timestamp": "2025-09-02T20:12:01.144Z"
        },
        {
          "step_id": "s2",
          "type": "responses.request",
          "model": "gpt-5",
          "mode": "text",
          "store": true
        },
        {
          "step_id": "s3",
          "type": "assistant.output",
          "output_text": "To fetch today’s weather, I need your location..."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "run_id": "run_2",
      "trigger": "chat.on_message",
      "input_text": "canberra",
      "steps": [
        {
          "step_id": "s1",
          "type": "chat.on_message",
          "payload": "canberra"
        },
        {
          "step_id": "s2",
          "type": "tool.get_weather_from_coords",
          "args": { "lat": -35.2809, "lon": 149.13 },
          "result": { "temp": "2°C", "summary": "chilly" }
        },
        {
          "step_id": "s3",
          "type": "assistant.output",
          "output_text": "In Canberra right now it’s about 2°C (very chilly)."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This structure allows you to:

* Generate **D2 diagrams** automatically.
* Feed **analytics** or dashboards.
* Replay sessions or runs for debugging or training.

---

## **6. Generating Visualizations**

From this JSON:

* A **session-level diagram** shows each run as a swimlane.
* **Drill-down diagrams** show step-level detail within a single run.
* Nodes link back to source log IDs or response IDs for debugging.

Example CLI for automated generation:

```
flowgen render --input thoughtflow.json --view session --output session.svg
flowgen render --input thoughtflow.json --view run --run-id run_2 --output run2.svg
```

## **7. Closing Thought**

A chat transcript shows what was said.
A **ThoughtFlow** shows **how it happened**.

By capturing sessions, runs, and steps in a structured way, you enable better:

* **Debugging**
* **Optimization**
* **Self-reflection**

This is the foundation for agents that **don’t just react — they evolve**.
